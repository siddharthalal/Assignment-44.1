1) A Fibonacci series (starting from 1) written in order without any spaces in between, thus producing a sequence of digits. Write a Scala application to find the Nth digit in the sequence.

    - Write the function using standard for loop.
    - Write the function using recursion
    
2) Create a calculator to work with rational numbers.
    - It should provide capability to add, subtract, divide and multiply rational numbers
    - Create a method to compute GCD (this will come in handy during operations on rational)
    - Add option to work with whole numbers which are also rational numbers i.e. (n/1)
    
    Achieve the above using auxiliary constructors. Enable method overloading to enable each function to work with numbers and rational.

3) Write a simple program to show inheritance in scala.

4) Write a simple program to show multiple inheritance in scala.
